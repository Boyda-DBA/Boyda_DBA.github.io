            <p class="mb-3" style="color: #f4f2ef;">Begining with the raw data in CSV format looked through the columns and data types to build an ERD for the structure of the database.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-500 mb-5">Dataset</h2>
            <img src="photos/openipf-data.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p class="mb-3" style="color: #f4f2ef;">The original dataset has 42 columns that detail historical data of powerlifting competitions begining in 1966 and continuing to the present day. 
                This data set comes with many interesting considerations that affect the chosen structure, such as the fact that a single lifter can be registered multiple times to a single competition as they can be in multiple divisions or compete with and without equipment. 
                There are also many examples of lifters that have been registered to different competitions with a different sex over time. The amount and types of data vary significantly over time based on the federation that the data is coming from.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-500 mb-5">ERD</h2>
            <img src="photos/open-ipf-erd.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p class="mb-3" style="color: #f4f2ef;">This ERD takes into account the many intricacies of this complex dataset. Many of the data points that I would have origionally thought woould exist in the lifter table are actually attributes of the lifter_meet table which records information about a lifters registration to a competition.
                 The Sex of the lifter needed to placed in the lifter meet table as it can vary for a lifter between competitions.
                 The lifter_table ended up with its own id rather than a composite as there would need to be about five attributes combined to reliably identify a single registrant. 
                 age_class and birth_year class are very similar although they are used by different federations within the dataset.
                 The birth_year_class assumes positions the participant in a category based on their maximum age for that year where as the age_class utilizes the actual age of the lifter on the day of competition.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-500 mb-5">Queries And Tuning</h2>
            <p class="mb-3" style="color: #f4f2ef;">After transforming the data into the chosen structure and loading it into a Postgres database, several queries were built for this dataset to display its complexity and explore views and performance tuning.</p>

            <p style="color: #f4f2ef;">Using the above structure I was able to load the data into a Postgres database and create queries to show the data.</p>

            <br>
            <p style="color: #f4f2ef;">This query shows the number of complaints per zipcode in the area of Manhattan. This query was used as an example of performance tuning with indexes.</p>

            <img src="photos/Screenshot_20240408_132840.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p style="color: #f4f2ef;">Looking at the query plan we can see that the additions of indexes for this query have reduced the execution time from 84.523ms to 5.934ms!</p>
